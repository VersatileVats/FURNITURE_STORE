# FURNITURE_STORE
For OkayG Dummy Project

Technologies Used:
1. Bootstrap 4
2. HTML5 & CSS3
3. Jquery (for DOM manipulations)

Apart from these core technolofies. I have used third party services like:
1. ekko-lightbox for the lightbox effect https://ashleydw.github.io/lightbox/
2. Slick slider for the sliding carousel https://cdnjs.com/libraries/slick-carousel

Key Features:
As this is made by Bootstrap, the site is fully responsive under all the screen sizes. 
1. index.html: I have used carousel-slider (bootstrap one), ekko-lightbox for the gallery section, accordions as well as cards.
2. about.html: Use of cards and slick-slider (3rd party slider for testimonial section)
3. services.html: Fictional services plan for customers
4. contact.html: Used the form but this one isn't connected to Netlify forms as this one is basically for UI experience.
